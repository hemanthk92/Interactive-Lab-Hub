 a. If we use the 5 band resistor. 
 First Band - Brown
 Second Band - Black 
 Third Band - Black
 Fourth Band - Black
 Fifth Band - Brown
 
 b. After setting up the circuit with a LED and switch we have to connect the arduino to a laptop as a power source. Then we click the switch to close the circuit which will cause current to flow and power the LED.  
 
 In order to light the LED we have to  connect the 5V pin on the microcontroller to postive end of the board. The current will through a resistor from another pin on the postive end of the board the general board. Here we have the
